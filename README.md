# Image Colorizer

## Description
This is a simple image colorizer using a GAN based Unet created in Pytorch. The mode was trained on the COCO dataset 
which is a dataset of about 20,000 images. The model was trained for 100 epochs and the results are shown below.
 
## Architecture

The model was trained using a GAN that has a discriminator and a generator. The generator is a Unet that takes in an 
image in the form of a tensor and outputs a tensor of the same size. This set is trained on a size of 256x256.
